# Business Rules 

## Catalogue 


This file type is used by brokers to transmit auction catalogue data to the Network for auctions regulated by the Australian Wool Exchange Limited. Brokers may transmit catalogue data for a sale in one or more parts. The first part will usually contain 80% or more of the total data for the sale, with subsequent transmissions comprising only the additional data not in the first transmission. Subsequent transmissions may also include changes or deletions of lots previously transmitted. Catalogue transmissions should comply with the AWEX Wool Selling Rules.

Picking up the first and subsequent transmissions does not necessarily mean a complete catalogue is available. A discrepancy report will also be available with the printed catalogue at the show floor, and will indicate such items as late results, corrections to transmitted data, additional "no lots" known at the time etc., that have occurred subsequent to the last transmission sent.

The last transmission sent for a particular section of a sale catalogue will be flagged as a final transmission to indicate that no more transmissions will be sent. Note that this transmission need not include any lot records for the related catalogue section if previously transmitted data is unchanged.

 1. Loop F1.
This loop is repeated until all catalogues have been transmitted.

2. Loop EI.
This loop is repeated until all of the codes to which the document is to be included or excluded have been listed.

 3. Loop S1.
New type 10/11A records will be required whenever any field on either of these records is different to preceding 10/11A transmitted  in current S1 loop.

 4. Loop L1.
This loop is repeated for each lot falling under the sale header. If the transmission is the final transmission for the related S1 loop, and previously transmitted information is not being changed, then no lot data is required. 

The type 51C, 51I, 51F, 51J, 51K, 51L, 51M, 51P, 51X and 51N records are included in the transmission if, and only if, the lot has the corresponding certificate. They may be included in any order. A type 51M will be followed by a type 51J for OML certificates. A type 51P will be followed by a type 51J for combination certificates. A type 51N will be followed by a type 51J for OMI certificates.

For more information on test certificates see Test Certificate in the Data Dictionary.

5. Loop L2.
This loop is repeated for each forward price record (maximum of two).  Optional and only required if forward prices apply in a non auction sale.

6. Loop L3.
This loop is repeated if more than three quality schemes are required. The Mulesing Status field is to be only included on the first loop. The record is repeated until all quality scheme information has been transmitted.

7. Loop B1.
This loop is repeated until all bale identification details are transmitted for all grower lots.

8. Loop B2.
This loop can be repeated for interlots and objectively matched lots. A new type 79B record will be included each time the Brand, Bale Description, Area of Origin or Location change.

9. Loop B3.
This loop is repeated until all bale identification details are transmitted for each 79B record.

10. Loop F2 + F3.
 Loop F2 is repeated if the lot has been tested using different instrument types e.g. Laserscan and OFDA.

Loop F3 is repeated if the lot has more than 9 occurrences of Fibre Diameter readings.  The maximum number of type 32 records within loop F3 is 9.
11. Loop T1.
This loop is repeated until all of the required 99 records are transmitted.

12. Record Type 00 - Transmission Header.
If the file is transmitted from the original transmitter to the final receiver through an intermediary, the values for Current Transmitter and Current Receiver will vary on the different legs of the journey.

Final Receiver.
For rules on populating this field reference the Exclusion/Inclusion 08 record notes in the data dictionary.

Access Password.
This is the password used by the Current Transmitter when transmitting to the Current Receiver.

Version Number.
This number must be provided when testing transmissions for new version releases. 

13. Record Type 10 - Wool Sale Header - Lots.
Season.
If the wool is to be sold at an auction sale, Season is the season of the auction sale; if it is to be sold at a private treaty sale, it is the season in which the wool was first sold (if the wool has been resold this will not necessarily be the same as the season of the current sale).

Sale Identity 
This group field contains the data elements: 
•        Selling Centre/Type 
•        Sale Number 

In Australia, the Selling Centre/Type may be a reserved code – refer Data Dictionary. Traditionally these reserved codes are assigned to the transmission of rostered open cry auction catalogues. 

Organisations transmitting other types of public catalogues must use a non-reserved Selling Centre/Type. Should an organisation require a code to be allocated for their exclusive use then please contact the WIEDPUG Secretary. 

In Australia, auction catalogues transmitted to the network for the reserved open cry auction selling centres are validated against a Sale Roster.  All other selling centres by default are not validated against a sale roster.  An organisation that has been allocated a code for their exclusive use, that requires validation, will need to contact the network provider to make necessary arrangements.

Centre - Storage.
The code for the Centre where the wool is presently stored. Centre - Storage will always match the Centre within Storage Organisation.

Centre - Delivery.
CONDITION
Mandatory if a freight charge is nominated. 
It is the nominated delivery centre that the freight charge or freight rebate applies to.

Catalogue Section.
Under existing auction arrangements, each catalogue should be separately sectionalised. Also refer catalogue page number.

Final Catalogue Flag.
The last transmission sent will be flagged as a final transmission to indicate that no more transmissions for that catalogue section are expected. If the transmission is the final transmission for a particular catalogue section, and previously transmitted information is not being changed, then the S1 loop of transmission need only to contain the type 10 record. The type 20, 51 and 80 records are not required, but only if the Final Catalogue Flag is set to ‘yes’ and there are no amendments required to the section.

Freight Rebate.
If a freight charge is included in the Post Sale Charge, then the freight rebate is the amount repaid by the broker to the buyer should the buyer not require the broker to transport the wool to the delivery centre.

Invoicing Organisation.
This is the organisation responsible for the invoicing of the wool, and to whom payment for the wool will be directed.  It is often the same as the releasing organisation and the selling organisation.

Releasing Organisation.
This is the organisation responsible for the storage of the wool, and to whom electronic or paper delivery orders will be directed for release to the buyer. It is often the same as the invoicing organisation and the selling organisation.

Selling Organisation.
This is the organisation responsible for performing the auction in which the wool is to be sold. It is often the same as the invoicing organisation and the document originator.
Delivery Basis.
This may have one of several values:
Delivered Nominated Destination (D).  The post sale charge includes freight to a nominated destination, usually the main shipping centre, and this will be invoiced at the time of sale the destination is nominated by the delivery centre. Loaded on Transport (L). The post sale charge does not include freight to the delivery centre. If the buyer requests that the broker arrange transport, the broker will apply a freight charge at the time of shipping.

Wool Type Group.
This is similar to the catalogue section which groups the lots by a range of wool types. This field can be used for restricting the selection of catalogues from the network. This field must be sent for all Auction Catalogue transmissions.

14. Record Type 11A - Wool Sale Header - Extension.
Storage Description.
CONDITION
Mandatory when Storage Organisation is not sufficient to efficiently identify the facility where the wool is stored. This may be a shed number, street address etc.
If there is more than one organisation within the Centre – Storage, a separate AWEX code is required for each organisation. If an AWEX code does not exist, apply for one from AWEX-EDI. 

Lot Available Date
The first date on which the wool is available for purchase.


 15. Record Type 20 - Lot Header.
Catalogue Page Number.
CONDITION 
Mandatory in New Zealand, optional in Australia.
The page number is transmitted to ensure that the receiver can replicate the published paper catalogue, by grouping lots into a single unique page number, within a selling broker’s catalogue.  A single seller’s catalogue is defined as the same Season, Sale Identity, and Selling Organisation.

If a catalogue page number is not transmitted then the receiver will assume there will be 17 lots per page – starting at the first transmitted lot per catalogue section.

No Lot Flag.
CONDITION 
1.  	Mandatory in New Zealand for all NO LOTS.
2.  	Mandatory in Australia for NO LOTS where the No Lot is the first lot in a catalogue section, and 	page numbers are not being transmitted.
In New Zealand, this field is used to indicate those lots appearing on the printed auction catalogue as NO LOTS. 

In Australia NO LOTS are not transmitted, and lots withdrawn from sale i.e. "no lotted" since the first catalogue transmission has occurred will be marked with an update flag of "deleted" on subsequent transmissions.

This field will contain a value if a Staple Strength is also present and the measurement is available.  It represents the Average Staple Strength of the lowest 25% of staples measured for Strength.

TEAM-3 Hauteur, TEAM-3 Hauteur – CV (%), TEAM-3 Romaine (%)
Any certificate issued (or reissued with a new Certificate ID Number) from 1st July, 2006 will be based on the TEAM-3 calculations.  Anything issued prior to 1st July, 2006 will be based on the TEAM-2 calculations.  A check against the Date Issued field in the 51L record will determine which TEAM formula has been used.

26. Record Type 51K - Length & Strength Comb Details
Staple Strength.
This field will contain a value of zero if any sublot within the combination does not have a strength measurement result.

Staple Strength – Lowest 25%

Bales
Contains the bales for that interlot component only.

29. Record Type 99 - Transmission Totals.
CONDITION
For every record type in the transmission file two field values are required; the first identifies the record type, the second contains the number of records of the type in the file. All record types with sub-types are totalled as one record type. This means that if the file contains five type 51P records, ten 51C records and five 51L records, the type 99 record will contain a count of twenty type 51 records.

•	The yields appear in a different order in the transmission from that used in the printed catalogue.
•	As the yields are transmitted to 2 decimal places, and printed to 1 decimal place, there may be rounding errors occurring when comparing the two.
